# SceneGraph  

SceneGraph is a real-time graph visualization tool designed to dynamically represent live data from video streams. It captures and displays relationships between people and objects, storing data points with attributes such as age and gender. The system integrates powerful AI models for object detection, tracking, and classification, making it suitable for real-time monitoring and analysis.  

## Features  
- ðŸ“Œ **Live Data Visualization** â€“ Dynamically represents detected entities and their relationships.  
- ðŸ“‚ **JSON Data Storage** â€“ Saves graph data in JSON format for easy retrieval and analysis.  
- ðŸ‘¤ **Entity Attributes** â€“ Supports age and gender classification for detected people.  
- ðŸŽ¯ **AI-Powered Detection & Tracking**  
  - **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) for object detection.  
  - **Ultralytics** models for gender and age estimation.  
  - **CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracker)** for robust object tracking.  
- ðŸ“¡ **Streaming Support** â€“ Processes live video feeds for real-time tracking.  
- ðŸ•’ **Timestamp Overlay** â€“ Displays current date and time on the stream for reference.  

## Possible Applications  
SceneGraph can be utilized in various fields where real-time object tracking and relationship visualization are valuable:  
- **Surveillance & Security** â€“ Monitor and analyze human-object interactions in real time.  
- **Retail & Customer Analytics** â€“ Track customer movements and engagement with store items.  
- **Smart Cities** â€“ Analyze pedestrian and vehicle interactions to improve urban planning.  
- **Research & Behavioral Studies** â€“ Study movement patterns and social interactions.  
- **Sports Analytics** â€“ Track player and object movements in games for performance analysis.  
- **Healthcare & Assisted Living** â€“ Monitor elderly or at-risk individuals for safety.
